### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh Kim, a software developer with a background in international logistics and the fine arts.

From the galleries of fine art to the seas of logistics, my career has taken me into software engineering to explore the building blocks of society. 
The passion with which I delved into supporting streaming and creative talent has driven me to gain opportunities and learn to code in this time of incredible growth.
