### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Josh, a Full Stack software engineer with a background in international logistics and the fine arts.

From there, I took that passion and curiosity to General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive where I spent over 700 hours learning an wide variety of skills, from learning languages and technical skills such as Javascript, Python, React.js, Express, Postman, Github and many more. I also gained and developed skills that development teams would need such as version control via Github,  pair coding and pre-coding planning. With these skills, I've built multiple projects that have strengthened my understanding of software development, which you can see in my portfolio.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending my time sharpening my reflexes, decision-making, and my short and long-term planning with video games while engaging and encouraging creative talent in the visual arts and in streaming communities. I'm eager to join a team of software engineers to learn more about software development while making use of my wide range of skills.
